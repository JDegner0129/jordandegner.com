# jordandegner.com
The repository for my personal website

## Purpose
Before you browse the code and wonder, "why the hell did he write a React app that isn't actually pulling data from anywhere or updating the page at all?", know that I'm fully aware of the needlessness for it. I wrote this website using React just to give myself practice writing (basic) React components and setting up a build configuration for React/ES6 apps. I'm also a fan of the code organization, whether it's bringing me benefit or not.

## Installing
Hopefully this is as easy a setup for you as it was for me:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jdegner0129/jordandegner.com.git
$ cd jordandegner.com
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Deploying
If, for some reason, you feel like you want to fork this and deploy your very own resume page with the exact same styling, this repo should be completely Heroku-ready. Just create a Heroku app, connect it to GitHub, and deploy away.

## Suggestions
If you see this site and have any suggestions for how to make it better, *please* submit an issue! I'd love to keep working on this, when I have time.
